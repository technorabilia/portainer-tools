# Portainer Tools: Merge and Host App Template definitions

[Portainer App Templates](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/settings/apps/) can be used to easily deploy Docker containers with predefined settings. At the moment it is not possible to add more than one App Template definition URL to Portainer. Merging App Template definitions has to be done by hand.

This application allows you to add your own App Template definitions, merge them with [existing ones](https://www.technorabilia.com/portainer-app-templates-for-linuxserver-io-docker-containers/) and host them on your own server. You can set the Portainer App Templates URL from within the application to easily switch App Template definitions.

Detailed information about installing and using the application and more can be found [here](https://www.technorabilia.com/portainer-tools-merge-and-host-app-template-definitions/).
